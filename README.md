## About this silly small project

I started this project before we were even dating, and I'm still very happy with the results. I'll be updating this website in due time, but I'll also let him have access to it so he can add whatever he wants to his blog. Anyways you guys are free to take any code you need from this site for your own <3 though do be aware that I've used code that isn't mine and is credited on this site. Resist from taking this code without crediting the creators.

## üç∞ Tech Stack

This sweet project was built with:
- HTML/CSS for the design (with lots of his favorite colors!)
- JavaScript for interactive elements
- A sprinkle of libraries for extra cuteness
- Heaps of love in every line of code and some open source stuff ‚ù§Ô∏è

## üçì A Note to My Boyfriend üçì

To the most wonderful person in my world - I hope this website makes you smile as much as you make me smile every day. Every pixel was coded with love!

Made with üíï and endless daydreams about you, muawh
