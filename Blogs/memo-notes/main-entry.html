	<br>
    Hey, and welcome to my blog. Here I'll document my life and some other stuff about programming and tech. Use the memo note on the left to navigate my blog. You may need to clear your cache to view new entries.
    <br><br>
    If you notice, on the left there are two default entries. <b>NEWSLETTERS</b> contain sub items that give input to content, which will be expanded over time. And at the top we have <b>NEWS & UPDATES</b>, these spaces are managed by Skye regarding website notifications.
