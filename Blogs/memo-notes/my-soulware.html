		<h2 class="cyber-h">MY SOULWARE</h2>
		First of all, I'd like to talk about me and my pookie, but more about her, Skye
		</p>
		She's been developing a lot of things, from her portfolio to a game she made as a gift for me,
		but she sometimes thinks her own skills aren't good enough for this career/area,but if y'all could see all projects,
		you would notice that all bad things that she said about her own skills are wrong!

		Well, y'all can see all her projects in her personal website and portfolio, below are the website links so y'all can take a look!
		</p>

		<a href="https://luvrksnsnskyedev.space/"> > SKYE PORTFOLIO</a>
		</p>
		<a href="https://luvrksknskyejourney.org/"> > SKYE JOURNEY</a>
		</p>
		All of her projects are so beautiful! I love each one of them and I think you'll love too.

		Since we're two devs who love coding and tech stuff, we've been collaborating in some projects,
		I'm not consider myself a design or frontend person because I'm more into backend development, 
		but I try to my best! (And when I say that, it's the true, I don't know how I'm doing this article in frontend hehehe)
		
		</p>
		Like the past project that we've made, her portfolio.
		I mean, she made at least the 90% of the project, because all design and frontend stuff was made by her, but I made a backend for her website,
		And y'all are wondering know what's that I made, well, her website has a chat feature but I did all the backend logic so you can send emails to her email address!
		That's what it's all about, a backend app to give the chat a real functionality!.
		
		</p>
		However, I don't want to extend so much about the project description and that stuff, so let's continue talking about her and me.

		</p>

		As I said, she's a talented dev, I love every single thing that makes her who she is even in coding, 
		she has all my pride and support in everything she makes.
		Even this website has been made by her as a gift for me, my god she's so adorable!
		
		</p>

		I can't even count how many things she has made for me.

		</p>

		In the end, we're a couple of silly devs who are into messing with code and write histories and lore too.
